## Overview

The Ballerina connector for Redis allows you to connect to Redis and manipulate key-value data stored in a Redis
database. You can use the connector to manipulate string, hash, list, set, and sorted set data types. The functionality
of the Ballerina connector for Redis is limited to the use of Redis as a database and cache. The message broker
functionality of Redis is not yet exposed through this module.

## Prerequisites

Before using this connector in your Ballerina application, complete the following:

* Make sure Redis cache is running in the local environment or use Redis cache running on the cloud (for
  example, [Redis Enterprise Cloud](https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview/)).
* Configure the connector with details related to redis cache such as hostname, port number and password.

## Quickstart

To use the Redis connector in your Ballerina application, update the .bal file as follows:

### Step 1: Import connector

Import the `ballerinax/redis` module into the Ballerina project as follows.

```ballerina
import ballerinax/redis;
```

### Step 2: Create a new connector instance

To access a Redis server, you need to create a client object of the `redis:Client` type, providing the required
connection parameters. This establishes a connection or pool of connections to the specified Redis server. 

Below is a code sample which creates a client object using `redis:ConnectionConfig`.

 ```ballerina
redis:ConnectionConfig redisConfig = {
    host: "localhost:6379",
    options: {
        connectionPooling: true,
        isClusterConnection: false,
        ssl: false,
        startTls: false,
        verifyPeer: false,
        connectionTimeout: 500
    }
};
 
redis:Client redis = check new (redisConfig);
```

### Step 3: Invoke connector operation

1. You can insert a value for a specific key as follows.

 ```ballerina
 string setResult = check redis->set("Project", "Ballerina");
 ```

2. Use `bal run` command to compile and run the Ballerina program.
